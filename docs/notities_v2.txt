------------------------Functions---------------------------

main.py
- main() : main game loop

resources.py
- load_tank_images(filenames, color) : loads all the tank images and stores it as a dictionary. Filenames arguments accepts a list/tuple with the filenames. The second argument is the color of the tank images that need to be loaded.
- load_image(filename) : returns an image based on the filename
- load_resources() : loads all the resources as global variables, to be called in main.py


-------------------------Research-------------------------------

- Colorkey
- How do packages/import statements work in python 2.7
- Need to make explosions datastructure / find out how they work
